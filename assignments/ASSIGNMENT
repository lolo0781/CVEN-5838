********************************************************************

(1) Add the method of manufactured solutions to one of the 2-D codes
developed in class, i.e., either the finite difference or finite
element code.

(2) Add at least two solutions to be used as manufactured solutions,
one of them captured exactly by the discrete method and one of them
not exactly captured by the discrete method.

(3) Perform a convergence study on the one not captured.  The
convergence study will consist of the following:

(3.1) An error norm, such as the sum of the squares of the differences
between the analytical solution and the numerical solution at each
point in the mesh, normalized by the square of the number of points in
the mesh.

(3.2) Plotting that error norm as a function of the number of points
in the mesh.

(4) Write a small report, 1-2 pages in length, that describe the
analytical solutions and shows a plot of convergence as a function of
grid points used.

(5) Upload results into your repository.  Separate out the report to
be in a different location than your code.

(6) Guide me to the correct locations for your code and the report
through a clearly written and easy to read README file, placed at the
top level of your repository.

(7) Note: Part of your grade will include how easy it is for me to
find the report and source code, how well written your README file is,
and how well documented your code is.

(8) Questions/Concerns: Don't hesitate to contact me.
